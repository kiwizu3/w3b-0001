# ExploreSolo Website Hero Section

This project is a hero section for a website inspired by a design on Dribbble, with some improvisations during development. I chose this specific design for two reasons: first, its minimalism and the contrasting colors used to attract users, and second, my unwavering passion for combining tourism with technology. I look forward to developing this into a fully functional directory with comprehensive information about Sri Lanka.
